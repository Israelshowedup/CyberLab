# Splunk Endpoint Authentication Monitoring (SIEM Lab)

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience using Splunk SIEM to monitor Windows endpoint authentication activity and detect failed login attempts.

## Objective
To ingest and analyze Windows Security Event Logs and identify suspicious authentication behavior using SPL queries.

## Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise (Free)
- Windows Security Event Logs
- SPL (Search Processing Language)

## What I Did
- Ingested Windows Security Event Logs into Splunk
- Built SPL queries to detect failed login attempts (EventCode 4625)
- Analyzed account and host behavior associated with authentication failures
- Created dashboards displaying authentication events for endpoint monitoring

## Key Detection
- Failed Windows authentication attempts (EventCode 4625)

## Outcome
Strengthened understanding of SIEM operations, log analysis, and endpoint security monitoring.
